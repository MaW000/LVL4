This is a responsive application that allows you 
to see the awesome display that the CSS property "linear-gradient" can have.
Change the colors or the angle of the gradient by clicking on the input boxes and
selecting a color from the color pallete. Watch the code block on the left as it 
responds to the changes and feel free to copy and paste what you've created into
your own code!
